Greedy1:
  1. Sort antennas based on cardinality of base stations it covers (high -> low)
  2. Select the highest one
  3. Walk through sorted range from step one, adding an antenna if it is profitable:
        Profitable: calculate for this antenna |# of base stations in this that don't receive signal upon adding this|/|# of total base stations that this covers|.
                    Adding this is a profit if the division above is below 0.5. 

Greedy2:
  1. Sort base stations based on cardinality of antennas that cover it (low -> high)
  2. Select the lowest base station, select an antenna that covers it, mark all base stations that it covers as covered.
  3. Walk through sorted range from step one, if the base station is not covered yet, add the most profitable antenna that covers it.
        Profitable: calculate for this antenna |# of base stations in this that don't receive signal upon adding this|/|# of total base stations that this covers|.
                    Adding this is a profit if the division above is below 0.5.
